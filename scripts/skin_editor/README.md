A Word from the Developers
==========================

This is the best/only LibGDX Skin Editor out there.  It is licensed under the Apache Licence.

As the only tool around, the font bit of it doesn't work.  Hence why if you progress up a directory you will encounter the gdx-fontpack.jar file.  Use this and then edit the fonts in manually by editing uiskin.json in the FVS4 project.  The file makes it easy to understand how it works.  **Remember to copy all files generated by gdx-fontpack, not just the new ones, and regenerate the fonts which have been generated previously**

Copy default.png, uiskin.png, uiskin.json, uiskin.atlas and all .fnt files into the assets folder to make them consumable in the game.  If I can be bothered to, I'll figure out something which removes these minor irritations.  Maybe a shell script.  I like shell scripts.
